      "long_description": "Aveo AI Design Draft generator is a project that I launched for <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">Aveo.dk</strong>, which is a subbrand of <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">Auxo</strong>, where I currently work.\nThe project is a tool that generates design drafts for websites, based on the users input. The main purpose of the generator is to give the user a visual representation of how their website could look, but also <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">collect leads</strong> for the <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">sales team</strong> to follow up on.\n\nThe generator uses the <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">OpenAI API</strong> to utilize their <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">LLM model</strong>, which is prompted with the users input and some design theory. Then the generator creates a response which includes design decisions, which then is handled by the plugin and used to generate the design draft, based on a lot of different design models and templates, created by me. The design draft is generated in plain HTML and CSS, which allows for the creation of interactive elements, using <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">JavaScript</strong>.\n\nThe generator is also utilizing a <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">CVR API</strong>, to collect data about the users company, which is then used to create a more <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">personalized design</strong> draft. And gives the sales team a better understanding of the users needs.\n\nUnfortunately the project is not open source, but you can see a demo of the generator in action, in the <strong style=\"color: #facc15\">video below</strong>.",
